# Python-Project
Draws colorful geometric patch patterns using Python’s graphics.py library. Includes three designs—finalPatch (nested squares), penultimatePatch (striped rectangles), and antepenultimatePatch (a mosaic grid combining both). Users pick patterns and colors, showcasing basic graphics and user input handling.

# Geometric Patch Patterns in Python

A simple Python program that creates vibrant geometric patch designs using the `graphics.py` library. This project offers three unique patch patterns with interactive color selection and pattern choice:

- **finalPatch:** A series of nested, progressively smaller colored squares.  
- **penultimatePatch:** Striped rectangles arranged in a structured, repetitive pattern.  
- **antepenultimatePatch:** A complex mosaic combining the previous two patterns across a grid, creating a rich visual tapestry.

## Features

- Interactive console input for pattern and color selection.  
- Dynamic drawing using the `graphics.py` library for easy visualization.  
- Demonstrates foundational concepts in graphics programming, user interaction, and geometric design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- `graphics.py` module (Zelle’s Graphics Library) — download from [here](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) and place it in your project directory or Python path.

### Running the Program

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
2. When prompted, choose which pattern to display:  
    - Enter `1` for **finalPatch**  
    - Enter `2` for **penultimatePatch**  
    - Enter `3` for **antepenultimatePatch**

3. Input color choices as requested (color names or initials).  

4. The graphical window will open displaying the chosen design. Click inside the window to close.

## Example Output

- Nested colorful squares  
- Vibrant striped rectangles  
- Intricate mosaic combining patterns
